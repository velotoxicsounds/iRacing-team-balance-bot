# About
This package is an asynchronous API "wrapper" for retrieving data from iRacing. We use the term "wrapper" loosely as iRacing does not yet have an officially documented API; However, we've done our best to build something that might resemble one.

The goal of this project is to provide access to iRacing stats in a manner that is convienent, flexible, and efficient. In using this package, if you find something in its design that goes against these goals, **we want to know.**

The contributors of this project use Discord as the primary means of communication; The [iRacing Open Wheel server](https://discord.gg/UwnhM7w) was created by the author of this project and hosts the channels for discussion there. When joining, please ask Jacob Anderson for the role to see the appropriate channels.
